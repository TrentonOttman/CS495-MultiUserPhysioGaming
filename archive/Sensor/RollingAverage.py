# The goal of this file is to obtain the rolling average of the EMG signal
# over a specified time window. This average will be used to determine whether
# the fist is clenched or relaxed. A method will return '1' if flexed and '0' if relaxed.
# This data will be passed to the Unity test environment to help us map
# a fist clench to jetpack activation.
